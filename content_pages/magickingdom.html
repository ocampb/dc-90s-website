    <h1>Magic Kingdom</h1>
    <p>
      On the first day of our trip, we visited the Magic Kingdom! While we
      visited Disney World twice as children, Mary Ellen didn't have any
      memories from the parks. We arrived early, before the park opened to make
      sure we had enough time to get through security and be the first in line
      for our bucket list rides.
